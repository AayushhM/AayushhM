# Hi, I'm Aayush! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for developing innovative solutions using cutting-edge technologies. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages and tools, including Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. I hold a degree in Electronics and Communication engineering.

I have developed several projects, including:

*Movie recommendation system:*

Skills used: Python programming/Data analysis and visualization using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib/Collaborative filtering techniques (User-User and Item-Item)/Singular value decomposition (SVD)/Nearest neighbor algorithms

*Breast cancer predictor app:*

Skills used: Python programming/Data analysis and visualization using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib/Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Random Forest/Model evaluation techniques (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score)/Flask for building web applications

*Car parking space counter using OpenCV:*

Skills used: OpenCV library for computer vision/Image processing techniques (e.g., thresholding, morphological operations, contour detection)/Object detection techniques (e.g., background subtraction, blob detection)/Python programming

*Object detector using YOLOv4:*

Skills used:YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm/Darknet framework for training and testing object detection models/Image annotation tools (e.g., LabelImg)/Python programming/OpenCV library for computer vision

I am constantly learning and seeking new challenges, and I am always looking for ways to use my skills to help others. Whether you're a business looking for a data-driven solution or a developer looking for a collaboration, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or LinkedIn.
